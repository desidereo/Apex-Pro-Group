# How to Secure Regional "Growth Hub" Grants (Option 5)
**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Actionable

Regional grants are often easier to win than national Innovate UK grants because the competition is lower (you are only competing with locals, not the whole UK).

## 1. The "Magic Words" to Search
The funding landscape changed in 2025. The key keyword is no longer just "European Regional Development Fund" (ERDF) but **"UK Shared Prosperity Fund" (UKSPF)**.

**Google this now:**
> `[Your City/County] business support UKSPF`
> `[Your City/County] growth hub digital grant`

## 2. Your Local Hubs (Harwich / Essex)
Since you are in **Harwich (Tendring District)**, you have two specific targets.

### Target A: Essex County Council (The "Creative" Route)
**URGENT DEADLINE:** There is a live grant closing **16 February 2026**.
*   **Name:** Creative Industries Project Development Fund
*   **Grant Size:** £2,500 - £30,000
*   **Why it fits:** "Software and Computer Services" are officially defined as Creative Industries by the UK Government (DCMS). You can pitch G-Labs as a "Digital Creative Platform for Financial Education".
*   **Link:** [https://culture-essex.co.uk/creative-industries-project-development-fund/](https://culture-essex.co.uk/creative-industries-project-development-fund/)
*   **Action:** Go to the link immediately. You have ~2 weeks.

### Target B: Tendring District Council (The "Business" Route)
*   **Hub Name:** Tendring4Growth
*   **Website:** [https://www.tendringdc.gov.uk/content/ukspf](https://www.tendringdc.gov.uk/content/ukspf)
*   **Email:** tendring4growth@tendringdc.gov.uk
*   **Status:** The 2025/26 round is ending (money must be spent by March 31, 2026).
*   **Strategy:** Email them **today** and ask: *"I am a Harwich-based tech business. Do you have any underspend from the 2025/26 UKSPF allocation that needs to be allocated before March 31st? I have a 'shovel-ready' digital project."* (Councils often panic-spend leftover money in Feb/March).

### Target C: Backing Essex Business (Support & Loans)
*   **Offer:** 12 hours free expert business advice + access to loans.
*   **Link:** [https://backingessexbusiness.co.uk/](https://backingessexbusiness.co.uk/)


## 3. What to Ask Them
Once you find their website or phone number, do not just ask "Do you have money?". Ask specifically:

> "I am a local software business. Do you have any active **Digital Growth Vouchers** or **Innovation Vouchers** funded by the **UK Shared Prosperity Fund**?"

## 4. Typical Grants Available (Examples)
*   **Digital Growth Grant:** £1,000 - £5,000 to buy new hardware (laptops, servers) or pay for a consultant (marketing/SEO).
*   **Low Carbon / Net Zero Grant:** If your software helps reduce carbon (e.g., efficient code, remote work tools), you can sometimes claim £5k.
*   **Innovation Vouchers:** £5,000 match-funding to work with a local university.

## 5. Next Steps
1.  **Tell me your location** (City or County) in the chat, and I will find the direct link for you.
2.  **Prepare a "Shopping List":** These grants are usually for *buying things*.
    *   List 3 things you need to buy (e.g., "High-performance workstation for AI training", "Professional SEO Agency contract", "Software Licenses").
    *   Get 3 quotes for each (they usually require 3 quotes to prove value for money).
