# Website & Digital Presence Audit: G-Labs Software
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Target:** [www.g-labs.software](https://g-labs.software)
**Objective:** Align digital presence with the new "EdTech / FinTech" grant narrative.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**Current Status:** The website currently positions G-Labs as a **Retail Trading Tool Provider**. The language focuses on "winning strategies," "beating the market," and individual trading struggles.
**Risk Level:** **HIGH**. To a grant assessor, this looks like a "high-risk" retail speculation service (gambling proxy), which is often excluded from government funding.
**Required Pivot:** We must re-brand as an **Educational Technology (EdTech) Platform** that provides "Financial Analytics" and "Risk Management Training."

## 2. Critical "Red Flag" Analysis
The following elements contradict our new "Project Neural-Fin" business case and need immediate attention.

### A. Problematic Language (The "Gambling" Triggers)
| Current Phrase (Risk) | Why it hurts funding | Suggested "EdTech" Replacement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Beating the Market Maker" | Implies gambling/speculation. | "Market Structure Analysis" |
| "Winning Strategies" | "Get rich quick" connotation. | "Probabilistic Data Models" |
| "Smart Money Concepts" | Retail buzzword (often considered 'guru' spam). | "Institutional Order Flow Analysis" |
| "Signals" | Implies financial advice (regulated activity). | "Algorithmic Market Alerts" |
| "Garry has tried almost every strategy..." | Sounds like a hobbyist/guru blog. | "Developed by a team of quantitative analysts..." |

### B. "One-Man Band" Perception
*   **Issue:** The "About" page focuses entirely on "Garry from London."
*   **Grant Impact:** Investors/Grants want to fund a *company*, not a person. It creates "Key Person Risk."
*   **Fix:** Rewrite the "About" section to focus on the **Company Vision**, the **Technology Stack**, and the **Team** (even if the team is small, use "We" instead of "I").

### C. Visual / UX Trust Indicators
*   **Missing:** No clear "Enterprise/B2B" section.
*   **Missing:** No physical address or registered company number in the footer (Critical for UK credibility).
*   **Current Aesthetic:** Focuses on "dark mode" charts which appeals to gamers/retail traders.
*   **Recommendation:** Add a "White Paper" or "Methodology" page to look more academic/scientific.

## 3. The "EdTech" Pivot Strategy (Action Plan)

### Phase 1: The "Safe" Homepage (Immediate - for Grant Verification)
*   **Headline:** Change from "Smart A.I Trading Algorithms" to **"Advanced Financial Analytics & Education for the Modern Era."**
*   **Hero Section:** Focus on **Education** and **Software**, not "Trading Profits."
*   **Call to Action:** Change "Buy Now" to "Start Learning" or "View Analytics."

### Phase 2: Product Renaming
*   **"Market Maker Dashboard"** $\rightarrow$ **"Institutional Cycle Explorer"**
*   **"Trade Manager"** $\rightarrow$ **"Risk Management Console"**
*   **"Discord Community"** $\rightarrow$ **"Quantitative Research Hub"**

### Phase 3: Credibility Boosters
1.  **Add Company Number:** Ensure G-Labs Ltd company number is visible in the footer.
2.  **Add "Methodology":** A page explaining that your tools are based on "Statistical Probability" (Maths), not "Secrets" (Hype).
3.  **Case Studies:** Replace "I made $500 today" testimonials with "This helped me understand market structure" (Educational outcome).

---

## 4. MQL5 & Third-Party Platforms
*   **Observation:** The MQL5 profile uses similar "retail" language.
*   **Action:** We cannot easily change MQL5 culture, but we should **unlink** it from the main "Corporate" site if possible, or create a specific landing page for Grant Officers that does *not* link directly to the MQL5 marketplace.

---

## 5. Summary Recommendation
To secure the £5k UKSPF grant and future Innovate UK funding, **G-Labs must look like a software company, not a trading signal provider.**

**Immediate To-Do:**
1.  Create a specific "Grant Landing Page" (e.g., `g-labs.software/mission`) that contains the new "EdTech" copy.
2.  Use this URL in the application form to shield the assessor from the legacy "retail" content.
