# Alternative Funding Strategy: Beyond Innovate UK
**For: G-Labs**
**Date:** February 2026

While Innovate UK is the "Gold Standard" for R&D grants, it is highly competitive. Diversifying your funding sources is critical for survival and growth. Below are the best non-Innovate UK options for a UK-based software/fintech company.

---

## 1. Government-Backed Start Up Loans (Debt Finance)
**Best For:** Immediate cash flow, marketing budget, or bridging the gap while waiting for grants.
*   **What is it?** A personal loan for business purposes, backed by the UK government.
*   **Amount:** Up to **£25,000 per director** (max £100,000 for 4 partners).
*   **Interest Rate:** Fixed at **6%** per annum (lower than most commercial bank loans).
*   **Terms:** Repay over 1–5 years. No early repayment fees.
*   **Pros:** High approval rate compared to grants; includes 12 months of free mentoring.
*   **Cons:** You are personally liable (it is a personal loan used for business).
*   **Eligibility:** Business trading for less than 3 years.
*   **Action:** Apply via the [British Business Bank](https://www.startuploans.co.uk/).

## 2. R&D Tax Credits (SME Scheme)
**Best For:** Recovering cash from money you have *already spent* on development.
*   **What is it?** A corporation tax relief that can either reduce your tax bill or result in a **cash payment** from HMRC.
*   **Value:** You can recover up to **18.6% to 27%** of your qualifying R&D costs.
*   **Qualifying Costs:** 
    *   Staff salaries (developers, you).
    *   Subcontractors/Freelancers (up to 65% of their cost).
    *   Software licenses.
    *   Cloud computing costs (AWS, Azure, etc.).
*   **Criteria:** You must be solving a "scientific or technological uncertainty."
    *   *Not R&D:* "We built a website."
    *   *Is R&D:* "We developed a novel neural network algorithm to detect market divergence in real-time with <10ms latency."
*   **Action:** Speak to your accountant immediately. You can claim for the last 2 financial years.

## 3. Fintech Accelerators (Equity Investment)
**Best For:** High-growth scaling, networking, and mentorship.
*   **What is it?** Intensive 3-6 month programs where you get cash + office space + mentorship in exchange for equity (shares).
*   **Top UK Fintech Accelerators:**
    *   **Barclays Rise:** Specifically for fintech. Connects you with bank decision-makers.
    *   **Techstars London:** Global prestige. Very competitive.
    *   **Antler / Entrepreneur First:** Good if you are looking for co-founders or pre-seed capital.
    *   **Founders Factory:** Corporate-backed (e.g., Aviva), good for B2B partnerships.
*   **Pros:** Instant credibility, huge network effects.
*   **Cons:** You give away shares (typically 5-10%).

## 4. SEIS / EIS (Angel Investment Incentives)
**Best For:** Attracting private investors (Angels, Friends & Family).
*   **What is it?** You don't get money from the government, but the **government gives your investors huge tax breaks**, making it much easier for you to raise money.
*   **SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme):**
    *   For early-stage companies (under £200k gross assets).
    *   investors get **50% tax relief**. If they invest £10,000, they get £5,000 off their tax bill.
    *   Risk-free for them: heavy loss relief if you fail.
*   **EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme):**
    *   For larger raises (up to £5m).
    *   30% tax relief for investors.
*   **Action:** Apply for "Advance Assurance" from HMRC. Having this certificate makes you 10x more attractive to investors.

## 5. Regional "Growth Hub" Grants
**Best For:** Small capital purchases (laptops, servers) or consultancy/training.
*   **What is it?** Local councils often have "pots" of money (e.g., UK Shared Prosperity Fund) to boost local business.
*   **Typical Grants:** £1,000 - £5,000 matched funding (you pay 50%, they pay 50%).
*   **Action:** Search for "[Your County/City] Growth Hub" (e.g., "Manchester Growth Hub", "Heart of the South West Growth Hub").
