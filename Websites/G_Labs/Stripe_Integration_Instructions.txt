# Stripe Integration Instructions

To start selling your G-Labs TradingView indicators, you need to replace the "Buy Now" buttons on your website with actual Stripe Payment Links.

## Step 1: Create Products in Stripe
1. Log in to your Stripe Dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Go to **Products** -> **Add Product**.
3. Create a product for each item on your website (e.g., "BTMM State Engine", "BTMM Scanner", etc.).
   - Set the **Price** (e.g., $149).
   - Upload a product image if you have one.
   - Save the product.

## Step 2: Create Payment Links
1. After saving a product, look for the **"Create payment link"** button on the product page.
2. Configure the link:
   - Ensure "Collect customers addresses" is unchecked (unless you need it).
   - Ensure "Allow promotion codes" is checked if you plan to run sales.
3. Click **Create Link**.
4. **Copy the URL** (it will look like `https://buy.stripe.com/...`).

## Step 3: Add Links to Your Website
1. Open the file `Websites/G_Labs/tradingview.html`.
2. Find the button code for each product. It looks like this:
   ```html
   <button class="btn-stripe" onclick="stripeCheckout('btmm-state-engine')">
       Buy Now
   </button>
   ```
3. Replace the `onclick` part with a simple link redirection using your copied Stripe URL.
   
   **Change it to this:**
   ```html
   <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_LINK_HERE" class="btn-stripe" target="_blank">
       Buy Now
   </a>
   ```
   *(Note: I changed `<button>` to `<a>` because it's a direct link).*
