**Main Website:** [https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/)

## Identified Target Competitions (February 2026)

### 1. Strategic Opportunity (Best for "Risk Literacy" Angle)
**Competition:** TechLocal: Connecting Local Talent to Local Tech Jobs
**Opens:** 4 February 2026
**Closes:** 18 March 2026
**Grant Size:** Share of £7.6m (Projects typically £100k - £225k)
**Fit:** Position G-Labs as a "Fintech Skills & Algorithmic Trading Training Platform".
**Requirement:** Must be a collaboration (need a partner, e.g., local college, training provider, or another tech SME).
**Why:** UK government is pushing for "Tech Talent". Moving from "Trading Bot" to "Fintech Education Platform" fits this perfectly.

### 2. Commercial Route (If you have revenue/growth)
**Competition:** Innovate UK Innovation Loans Round 25
**Status:** OPEN NOW
**Closes:** 4 March 2026
**Loan Size:** £100k - £5m
**Fit:** For "Scaling" the existing product.
**Note:** This is a LOAN, not a free grant. Requires repayment, but easier to get than pure grants if you have a business case.

### 3. The "Standard" Route
**Competition:** Smart Grants
**Status:** Always Open (Quarterly rounds)
**Fit:** "Game-changing R&D". Highly competitive.
**Strategy:** Focus on the AI/Neural Network aspect of the scanner as a "Market Risk Analysis Tool".

## Project Title: AI-Driven Financial Risk Literacy & Simulation Platform

### 1. Public Description (for publication if successful)
*Must be non-confidential and written for a general audience.*

G-Labs is developing an innovative AI-driven educational platform designed to democratize access to institutional-grade financial risk management tools. In an era where retail participation in financial markets is at an all-time high, the risk of significant consumer financial loss due to lack of sophisticated analysis tools is critical. This project will deliver a "Virtual Risk Analyst" – a machine learning system that analyzes market conditions in real-time to alert users not just to opportunities, but specifically to high-risk scenarios and capital exposure. By combining Neural Network market structure analysis with automated risk-limiting protocols, the platform aims to shift the retail trading paradigm from "gambling-like" speculation to data-driven, risk-managed asset allocation. This technology will empower UK retail investors with the same risk-management capabilities used by professional proprietary trading firms, fostering a more resilient and financially literate retail investment sector.

### 2. Project Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")
*Key focus: Innovation, Risk Reduction, Technical Feasibility.*

**The Challenge:**
Retail participation in financial markets has exploded, yet 70-80% of retail traders lose money due to poor risk management and emotional decision-making. Current market tools focus on "signals" (telling users what to buy) rather than "safety" (telling users when NOT to buy). There is a lack of accessible technology that enforces professional risk parameters (e.g., drawdown limits, exposure caps) for the average user.

**The Innovation:**
G-Labs proposes to develop the "Neural Risk Engine," a proprietary software module that integrates:
1.  **Deep Learning Market Structure Analysis:** Using Neural Networks to identify "Order Blocks" and "Fair Value Gaps" with higher precision than standard algorithmic scripts, filtering out false positives that lead to losses.
2.  **Automated Risk Enforcement:** A "Digital Guardian" system that acts as an automated risk manager, preventing users from executing trades that violate pre-set safety rules (e.g., maximum daily drawdown, over-leveraging).
3.  **Real-Time Simulation:** A "Prop Firm" simulation environment where users can prove their profitability in a safe, sandboxed environment before risking real capital.

**The Outcome:**
A commercially viable SaaS platform that reduces retail trader failure rates. The project will transition G-Labs from a provider of simple indicators to a comprehensive EdTech and FinTech solutions provider.

### 3. Impact & Benefits
*   **Economic:** Increases the financial longevity of retail investors, keeping capital within the UK economy rather than losing it to international high-frequency trading firms.
*   **Social:** Promotes responsible financial behaviour and reduces the "gambling" psychology often associated with retail trading.
*   **Technological:** Advances the application of Neural Networks in real-time, low-latency financial time-series analysis on consumer-grade hardware.

### 4. Why Public Funding?
This project carries significant technical risk in the development of the Neural Network's accuracy and the integration of real-time risk enforcement across multiple broker platforms. Private investment often demands immediate aggressive monetization (high fees, signal selling), which conflicts with our goal of creating a "safety-first" educational tool. Grant funding allows us to prioritize the robustness of the risk-protection algorithms over short-term profit seeking.

## Key Application Tips (Do's and Don'ts)

**DO:**
*   Use words like: **"Risk Management," "Financial Literacy," "Consumer Protection," "Machine Learning," "Simulation," "Data Analytics."**
*   Highlight the **"Prop Firm"** aspect as a "Training Ground" or "Skill Accreditation" system.
*   Emphasize that the Neural Network is for **identifying market structure** (an analytical task), not just "predicting the future" (a speculative task).

**DON'T:**
*   Do NOT use words like: "Easy money," "Guaranteed profit," "Crypto bot," "Automated income," "Passive income."
*   Do NOT claim the software trades *for* them (unless you are applying for a specific AI automation grant, but usually, "fully autonomous financial advice" requires heavy regulation). Frame it as "Decision Support."
