# Customer "Win-Back" Communication Strategy
**Goal:** Convert cancelled TradingView subscribers back to paying members *before* or *immediately after* removing their access.

**Concept:** Do not just "remove access." Use the removal as a trigger event to make a special offer.

### Template 1: The "Service Interruption Warning" (Send 48 hours BEFORE removing access)
**Subject:** Action Required: Your G-Labs Access is expiring in 48 hours
**Medium:** Email / TradingView Private Message / Telegram DM

Hi [Name],

I noticed your G-Labs subscription has been cancelled. To ensure fair access for all members, our system is scheduled to remove your access to the [Indicator Name/Package] on **TradingView** in 48 hours.

I’d hate for you to lose your edge in the markets right now. We’ve recently updated the tools with [mention a new feature, e.g., "new Order Block detection" or "Prop Firm Risk settings"] that you might haven't seen yet.

**Want to stay?**
I’ve set up a special "Loyalty Link" for you to reactivate at our legacy rate (or get a discount):
👉 [Insert Link to Stripe/Payment Page with Discount]

If you’ve moved on, no worries at all! I’ll proceed with removing access on [Day/Time]. You can always rejoin later at the standard price.

Best trading,
Garry
G-Labs Team

### Template 2: The "Access Removed" Notification (Send IMMEDIATELY AFTER removing access)
**Subject:** Update on your G-Labs TradingView Access
**Medium:** Email / TradingView Private Message

Hi [Name],

Just a quick heads-up that your access to the G-Labs indicators on TradingView has now been deactivated as your subscription period has ended.

If you open your charts and see "Access Denied" errors, this is why—don't panic, your charts are fine, just the G-Labs overlays have been paused.

**Did you cancel by mistake?**
It happens! If you want to jump back in, use this link to reactivate instant access:
👉 [Insert Link]

**Free Resource:**
Even if you aren't subscribing right now, I want to make sure you keep winning. Here is a free copy of our **"Smart Money Concepts Manual"** to help with your manual analysis:

Keep crushing it!

### Strategy for Manual Removal
Since you have to do this manually, use it to your advantage:
1.  **Batch Process:** Do them all at once on a Friday afternoon or Monday morning.
2.  **The "Personal Touch":** Because you are doing it manually, you can actually send a personal DM on TradingView.
    *   *Message:* "Hey [Username], just auditing the access list. Saw your sub was cancelled so I have to remove the access today. Hope the tools served you well! If you ever want back in, hit me up for a discount code. Cheers, Garry."
3.  **Why this works:** It's not a "bot" banning them. It's a human. They might reply: "Oh wait, my card expired! I didn't mean to cancel! How do I pay?" -> **Boom, recovered sale.**

### Where to manage this list?
Create a simple Excel/Google Sheet:
*   **Column A:** TradingView Username
*   **Column B:** Expiry Date
*   **Column C:** Status (Active / Cancelled / Warning Sent / Removed)

Don't just delete them. Mark them as "Removed" so you have a list of "warm leads" to email in 3 months with a "We miss you" offer.
