# MQL5 PRODUCT LISTING: BTMM STATE ENGINE

## 1. PRICING STRATEGY
**Status:** You have validated High Ticket sales ($125/yr - $200 Bundle). Do NOT lower the brand value with a $49 sticker.

*   **MQL5 Price:** **$149 USD** (Lifetime)
    *   *Why?* This aligns with your $125/year TradingView price. It's a "deal" compared to the annual sub, but still premium enough to command respect.
    *   *Psychology:* "Why pay $125/year when I can own the MT5 version for $149?" -> Drives sales.
*   **Rental Option:** **$49 USD / Month**
    *   *Why?* Anchors the price. If renting is $50, buying at $150 (3 months rent) seems like a smart investment.

<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>STOP GUESSING. SEE THE STATE.</h1>
<h3>The only indicator that tracks the Market Maker's Cycle in Real-Time.</h3>
</div>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is the Official MT5 version of the G-Labs State Engine. (Previously available only via Private Invitation).</p>

<p>Most indicators lag. They tell you what <i>happened</i>. The <b>BTMM State Engine</b> tells you what the Market Maker is <i>doing</i>.</p>

<p>Designed by <b>G-Labs (Powered by Apex Pro Group)</b>, this algorithm ignores standard "price action" and instead tracks the underlying <b>State</b> of the dealer cycle. It identifies exactly when institutions are Accumulating orders, Manipulating the highs/lows, and Distributing profit.</p>

<h3>✅ WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>No Repainting:</b> Once a State is confirmed, it stays. Perfect for backtesting.</li>
    <li><b>Prop Firm Safe:</b> No Martingale, No Grid, No dangerous compounding. Just pure precision.</li>
    <li><b>Edge-First Logic:</b> Built on the same logic used by our Institutional Edge Nodes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>📊 KEY FEATURES</h3>
<p><b>1. The Cycle Identifier</b><br>
Instantly see if the market is in Level 1 (Consolidation), Level 2 (Trend), or Level 3 (Exhaustion). Never trade against the cycle again.</p>

<p><b>2. Liquidity Voids</b><br>
The engine highlights "Unfilled Orders" (Imbalances) where price <b>must</b> return to balance the books. These are your Take Profit targets.</p>

<p><b>3. Multi-Timeframe Dashboard</b><br>
Monitor the "State" of M15, H1, and H4 simultaneously. Align the cycles for high-probability "Sniper" entries.</p>

<h3>🎯 HOW TO TRADE IT</h3>
<ol>
    <li><b>Wait for the State:</b> Let the Engine confirm a "Level 3" Exhaustion.</li>
    <li><b>Wait for the Break:</b> Price breaks the "Asian Range" or "Daily Open".</li>
    <li><b>Enter:</b> Take the trade back towards the Liquidity Void.</li>
</ol>
