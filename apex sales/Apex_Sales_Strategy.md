## 2. Sales Strategy: MQL5 & TradingView Products

### A. Optimization of Existing MQL5 Profile
**The Problem:** Most MQL5 sellers look like hobbyists.
**The Fix:** "Institutional Grade Retail Tools".

1.  **Profile Rebrand:**
    *   Change Seller Name to "G-Labs (Powered by Apex)".
    *   *Bio:* "Institutional Grade Algorithms for the Retail Trader. Built by Apex Pro Group, simplified for MT5."
    *   *Social Proof:* "As seen on YouTube @g-labs | 10k+ Community."

2.  **Listing Optimization (The "Stack" Method):**
    *   Don't just sell an indicator. Sell a **System**.
    *   *Headline:* "BTMM State Engine: The Institutional Market Maker Tracker."
    *   *Screenshots:* Do not just show the chart. Show the **Win Rate Backtest** and a "Profit PnL" screenshot (even if demo).
    *   *Video:* Every product MUST have a 60-second YouTube video embedded. "Watch the State Engine catch a 50-pip drop in real-time."

3.  **The "Review Engine":**
    *   Offer a "Bonus Set File" or "PDF Guide" to anyone who leaves a 5-star review.
    *   *Automated Message:* "Thanks for purchasing! Send me a screenshot of your review and I'll send you my personal 'Gold Scalping' settings."

### B. Launching the "BTMM State Engine" (New Product)
**The Hook:** "Stop guessing the Market Maker's move. See their State."

1.  **The "Leak" Campaign (Pre-Launch):**
    *   *YouTube:* Post a video titled "I found a flaw in the Market Maker's Algorithm."
    *   Show the State Engine predicting a reversal *before* it happens.
    *   Don't sell it yet. Say "Releasing in 48 hours to the Discord list only."

2.  **Pricing Strategy (The "Decoy"):**
    *   **Option A:** Monthly Rent ($49/month). (Makes the lifetime look cheap).
    *   **Option B:** Lifetime License ($299). **(The Goal)**.
    *   **Option C:** "Full Suite Bundle" ($499). Includes State Engine + Your other top 2 indicators.

3.  **The "Prop Firm" Angle:**
    *   Explicitly market it as "Prop Firm Safe".
    *   "Pass your FTMO challenge using State Engine logic. No Martingale, No Grid. Pure Price Action."
    *   *Why?* Prop firm traders are desperate and have money to spend.

### C. TradingView Strategy
**The Problem:** It's hard to sell directly on TradingView.
**The Fix:** Use TradingView as a **Lead Magnet**.

1.  **The "Free-mium" Script:**
    *   Release a "Lite" version of the State Engine on TradingView for FREE.
    *   *Limit:* It only works on the 1H timeframe (or lacks the "Signal" alerts).
    *   *The Hook:* "Want to see this on the 1-Minute chart for Scalping? Get the PRO version at [Link]."

2.  **Live Streaming:**
    *   Go LIVE on TradingView streams (they push live streams hard).
    *   Just have the State Engine running on Bitcoin or Gold.
    *   Answer questions. When it hits a TP, say "The State Engine just paid for itself."

## 3. The "Funnel" (Turning $50 buyers into $5,000 Clients)
We don't just want small sales. We want to find the "Whales" for Apex Pro Group.

*   **Step 1:** User buys MQL5 Product ($50).
*   **Step 2:** User joins "G-Labs VIP Discord" (Link in the product description).
*   **Step 3:** You engage in Discord.
    *   *Spot the Whale:* "Who here is trading >$50k accounts?"
*   **Step 4:** The Upsell.
    *   "Hey, for large accounts, latency kills you. You need the **Apex Edge Node**. It runs the State Engine 100x faster than your laptop. DM me for the institutional setup."

## 4. Immediate Action Plan (Next 7 Days)

1.  **Website:**
    *   Buy domain `apexprogroup.co.uk` (or similar).
    *   Put up a "One-Page" Corporate site. (Dark theme, "High Frequency Compute", "Essex R&D").
    *   *Purpose:* Just for the Grant Assessor to click on.

2.  **MQL5:**
    *   Rename/Update the Bio to reference "Apex Pro Group" (Adds authority).
    *   Draft the "BTMM State Engine" sales page (Focus on "Prop Firm Safe").

3.  **YouTube:**
    *   Record the "Market Maker Flaw" video for the State Engine launch.
