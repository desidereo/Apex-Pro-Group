## Part 2: "BTMM State Engine" - MQL5 Product Description
**Goal:** High conversion sales. Focus on "Prop Firm" passing and "Secret Knowledge".

### [Product Title]
**BTMM State Engine: The Institutional Market Maker Tracker (Prop Firm Safe)**

### [The "Hook" - First Paragraph]
**Stop guessing the trend. Start seeing the "State".**
Most indicators lag. They tell you what *happened*. The **BTMM State Engine** tells you what the Market Maker is *doing*.
Designed by G-Labs (Powered by Apex Pro Group), this algorithm tracks the underlying "State" of the dealer cycle—Accumulation, Manipulation, or Distribution—in real-time.

### [Key Features - Bullet Points]
✅ **Cycle Identifier:** Instantly see if the market is in Level 1, 2, or 3. No more trading against the trend.
✅ **Liquidity Voids:** Highlights exactly where price *must* return to balance the books.
✅ **Prop Firm Safe:** Non-repainting. No Martingale. No Grid. Perfect for passing FTMO, MFF, and other challenges with strict drawdown rules.
✅ **Multi-Timeframe Dashboard:** See the state of M15, H1, and H4 on a single chart.

### [The "Secret" Sauce]
This isn't just an RSI or MACD. The State Engine uses a custom volatility-adjusted volume calculation to detect **Institutional Injection**—the exact moment big money enters the market.

### [What You Get]
1.  The BTMM State Engine Ex5 File.
2.  **BONUS:** The "Gold Scalper" Preset File (Optimized for XAUUSD).
3.  **VIP Access:** Invite to the G-Labs Discord Community.

### [Price Anchor]
Launch Price: **$49.00** (Will increase to $149.00 after first 100 downloads).
